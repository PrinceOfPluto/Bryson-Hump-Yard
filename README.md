# Railroader - Bryson Hump Yard

This expands the Bryson yard lead into an 8 track hump yard with space for 18 cars per track.

There is a bypass track to access the yard without going over the hump. The hump has an incline of about 4 car lengths with a max grade of 2.9% and about 3 car lengths of decline with a max grade of 3.6%.
